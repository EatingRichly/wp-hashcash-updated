Client-side javascript blocks all spam bots. HTML5 compliant. Now with support for WordPress Versions 3.1+

== Description ==

= No More Spam =

Hashcash Updated is an antispam plugin that eradicates comment spam on Wordpress blogs. It works because your visitors must use obfuscated javascript to submit a proof-of-work that indicates they opened your website in a web browser, not a robot. If the javascript check fails, Hashcash Updated now gives you three options; it can either put the comment into moderation (default), put the comment in the akismet queue, or delete it.

Hashcash Updated is 100% GPL compatible.

= History =
This plugin started out 9 years ago by Elliott Back (ecb29) with the name WP-Hashcash, later down the road Donncha Ã“ Caoimh (donncha) started helping with development. In February 2011 the plugin was abanondoned and did not recive any more updates.

In April 2012 (azizmb) forked WP-Hashcash and released it under the name WP-Hashcash Extended fixing the problem with not being able to change the settings in the origional plugin. After the update in April it did not recieve any more updates.

In May 2014 Eric Johnson (wormeyman) forked WP-Hashcash Extended from the GitHub WordPress plugins mirror and renamed it [Hashcash Updated](https://github.com/wormeyman/wp-hashcash-updated), Pull Requests are encouraged!

I do not know how to do this but if someone would like to help that would be awesome!

No this will not, however they have their own anti-spam technology.
